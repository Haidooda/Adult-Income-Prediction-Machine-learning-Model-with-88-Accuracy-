# Adult-Income-Prediction-Machine-learning-Model-with-88-Accuracy-
This is a machine learning model using all single and ensemble techniques to determine an individual’s annual income results from various factors.  The income is divided into two classes: <=50K and >50K.
# At the end of the project I have come to :
• The best models that achieve highest accuracy comparing to others after performing Balancing using Smote technique specifically and Hyperparmeter Tunning using Grid Search are : Random Forest and Extra Trees with accuracy 0.8658630597799425 ,0.876024949190553 in order,As shown difference between them in acuuracy doesn't exceed 1%.
• The model with the highest accuracy is Extra Trees  with almost  test accuracy 88 %.
